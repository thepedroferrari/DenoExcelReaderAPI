# Deno XLSX to API

This program launches a web server at port 8080

The server will read a specific XLS file and return its contents in JSON format.

To run this program you must have Deno installed. https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

## Installation

Deno works on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Deno is a single binary executable. It
has no external dependencies.

On macOS, both M1 (arm64) and Intel (x64) executables are provided. On Linux and
Windows, only x64 is supported.

scripts to download and install the binary.

```shell
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh
